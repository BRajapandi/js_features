## Check if permission is provided by client or not

use -> Notification.permission;
// default, granted, denied - values

## Ask for permission to allow notifications

Notification.requestPermission().then(data=>{}).catch(e=>log("error",e))

## show Notification

The Notification() constructor creates a new Notification object instance, which represents a user notification.

new Notification(title)
new Notification(title, options)

let notificationObject = new Notification("Notification Title",{
"body":"Notification Content",
"icon":"icon.png"
})

## navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration().then((reg)=>{

    reg.showNotification("Helo !",options);

})

## options

dir:
The direction in which to display the notification. It defaults to auto, which just adopts the browser's language setting behavior,
but you can override that behavior by setting values of ltr and rtl (although most browsers seem to ignore these settings.)

badge:
A string containing the URL of the image used to represent the notification when there isn't enough space to display the notification itself.

Body:
A string representing the body text of the notification, which is displayed below the title.

tag:
A string representing an identifying tag for the notification. The default is the empty string.

icon:
A string containing the URL of an icon to be displayed in the notification.

image:
a string containing the URL of an image to be displayed in the notification.

data:
Arbitrary data that you want associated with the notification. This can be of any data type.

vibrate:
A vibration pattern for the device's vibration hardware to emit with the notification. If specified, silent must not be true.
navigator.vibrate([200, 100, 200]);

renotify:
A boolean value specifying whether the user should be notified after a new notification replaces an old one. The default is false, which means they won't be notified. If true, then tag also must be set.

requireInteraction:
Indicates that a notification should remain active until the user clicks or dismisses it, rather than closing automatically. The default value is false.

silent:
A boolean value specifying whether the notification is silent (no sounds or vibrations issued), regardless of the device settings. The default is false, which means it won't be silent. If true, then vibrate must not be present.

actions: dout

An array of actions to display in the notification. Each element in the array is an object with the following members:

action: A string identifying a user action to be displayed on the notification.
title: A string containing action text to be shown to the user.
icon: A string containing the URL of an icon to display with the action.
Appropriate responses are built using event.action within the notificationclick event.
